# GreenLight
The goal of this project is to design a software intending to conserve electricity based on human detection. This system will use a simple CCTV camera to detect human presence and light presence in classrooms. In case the classroom is detected empty and the lights are on, the system will notify the administrator regarding the same via a live notification Furthermore this system will allow the administrator to have access to the real time status of all classrooms in the campus through a website. This system will make administration easier and prevent unnecessary electricity wastage.
